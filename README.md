### Game Description

This game is a puzzle game where the player has to find their way through a maze to figure out who they really are.

### Control
1. Use arrow keys to move around the map and push rocks out of the way to uncover the exit of the maze.
2. If the player is close enough to an interactable character (indicated by an arrow above that character),
   press E key to talk to that character.

### Mechanics
1. One of your goals will be to travel through the maze with as little steps as possible.
2. Cut scenes will be triggered when you get close enough to the mysterious person and press E.
3. There will be certain sections of the walls of the maze that seem to be more like rocks than walls.
4. You will be able to push these out of the way by pressing your character against them.
